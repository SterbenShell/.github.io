<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

<p>My name is Michael Choi and I am a current Junior at Allen High School. I am 16 years old with an aspiration to work in the Computer Science field. I am currently enrolled in Computer Science II advanced, and my teacher is Mr. Ben-Yaakov. This currently seems to be a promising year, and this class will help me decide if this is the right field for me.</p>
<p>I do not have any prior experience/knowledge of computer science before I took Computer Science I in my sophmore year of high school, but I plan on joining clubs and finding other ways to expand my knowlege.</p>
