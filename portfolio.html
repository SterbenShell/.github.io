<h1>WHY MY PORTFOLIO IS IMPORTANT TO ME</h1>
<p>My portfolio is important to me because I want to display my current place in computer science. My place in computer science is always going to change and in the near future this will be a place for colleges too look at to help determine if I am a suitable applicant. This also applies to my job, which will take place years later. I want this portfolio to show who I am and what I want to do in this field, while also displaying my acheivements.</p>
<p>One of my goals is to make this url look like a professional website before the end of the semester as a little side project.</p>
