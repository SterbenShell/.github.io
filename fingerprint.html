    <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure(or HTTPS) is a more secure version of HTTP, which was created to enhance users' security and privacy, which has lead to a great number of websites using it for its function. Following the creation of HTTPS, Private institutions responded to this by using new technology known as "HTTPS Proxy Appliances", which is built to combat the user privacy and allows the private institution to gain intel onto everything you do.</p>
    <p>The Man in the middle(MITM) is a cyberattack in which an attacker secretly relays, and sometimes, modifies communications between two parties who believe they are communicating directly. A cryptographic hash is a complex mathematical algorithm that carefully processes everything it "digests". They have the surprising property that if even one bit in the certificate is changed, on average half of the hash bits in the fingerprint are changed accordingly. In other words, "fingerprinting" a certificate with such a cryptographic hash will result in a completely different fingerprint, no matter how small the change.</p>
    <p>Certificate Authorities"(CA) are entities that websites prove their identity using incoporation documentation, their telephone numbers, Dun and Bradstreet Records, etc. Once a website has proven its identity, the CA willingly puts its reputation on the line by signing a security certificate. An SSL Interception cannot be prevented because you can never completely spoof any security certificate, but it can be reliably detected by using hashes as previously mentioned. False Positives are incorrect indications of a certain condition, while False Negatives are incorrect indications of lacking a condition.</p>
    <p>Your school, government, ISP, etc. have a right to eavesdrop on all communications by law. They can monitor network activity and everything you do which is very disturbing.</p>
